    <string name="instructions">How to Play:
    \nWhen the first round begins, players are dealt 3 cards. This number increments:
    4 cards are dealt in round 2, 5 in round 3, and so on, up to 13 in the last one, round 11.

    \nThe player who goes first (that\'s you!) draws a card from either the draw or discard pile.

    \nYour objective is to make sets or runs from your hand.

    \nA set is a group with 3 or more cards of the same rank.
    \nExample: the 5 of hearts, clubs, and spades.

    \nA run is a group with 3 or more cards of incrementing ranks and same suit.
    \nExample: a 6, 7, and 8 of diamonds.
    \nThe add to and remove group buttons are useful for organizing cards.

    \nYou can put any cards you want into a group together. It is meant to help you keep track of
    possible runs or sets. Simply select the cards you want together, and then click the button.
    You must discard a card each turn. Select the card you want to get rid of and then click the
    discard button.

    \nOnce all of the cards in your hand, except for one, which would theoretically be discarded,
    have been put into groups, each with a complete run or set, click
    the go out button. This will give your opponent one last turn before ending the round.

    \nThe goal is to end each round with the lowest score possible. Each kind of card is associated
    with a certain point value: 1 point for an ace, 2 for a 2, 3 for a 3, and so on, up to
    13 for a king. The points associated with any cards in your hand at the end of the round that are
    not a part of complete sets or runs are added to your total score. When you go out, 0 is added to
    your score for that round.

    \nThe player with the lowest score at the end of the 11 rounds wins.
    Good luck!</string>
