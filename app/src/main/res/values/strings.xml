    <string name="instructions">How to Play:
    \nAt the start of each round, the players are dealt an incrementing number of cards, starting with
    3.  The player who goes first(that\'s you!), draws a card from the draw pile or the discard pile.
    \nYour next objective is to make sets or runs from your hand.
    \nA set is a group of 3 or more cards of the same rank.
    \nExample: 5 of hearts, 5 of clubs, and 5 of spades.
    \nA run is a group of 3 or more cards of incrementing ranks and same suit.
    \nExample: 6 of diamonds, 7 of diamonds, and 8 of diamonds.
    \nClick a card to select and add to a group.  Deselect a card by clicking it again and remove a
    card from your group with the remove from group button.
    \nOnce you have a playable group, click go out to play it!  If you have no playable groups or
    you\'ve played your group(s) already, discard a card and end your turn.
    \nYour AI opponent will do the same on its turn.
    \nYour goal is to have less cards in your hand than the AI does each round, resulting in the
    lowest score.
    \nA card of higher rank, like a queen, will have a higher penalty if it stays in your hand.
    \nGood luck!</string>
