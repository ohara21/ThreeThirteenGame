    <string name="instructions">How to Play:
    \nWhen the first round begins, players are dealt 3 cards. This number increments up to 13
     cards in round 11.

    \nThe player who goes first draws a card from either the draw or discard pile.

    \nYour objective is to make sets or runs from your hand.

    \nA set is a group with 3 or more cards of the same rank.

    \nA run is a group with 3 or more cards of incrementing ranks and same suit.

    \nWhenever you have a set or run, select the cards and click add to group.
    To undo, select the cards and click remove from group.

    \nYou must discard each turn. Select the card you want to get rid of and click the
    discard button.

    \nOnce all of the cards in your hand except for one have been put into groups, click
    the go out button. This will give your opponent one last turn before ending the round.

    \nCards are associated with a certain point value, starting with 1 point for an ace and
    going up to 13 points for a king. Points for cards in your hand at the
    end of the round that are not a part of groups are added to your total score. The goal is
    to end each round with the lowest score possible. When you go out, 0 is added to your
    score for that round.

    \nThe player with the lowest score at the end of the 11 rounds wins.
    Good luck!</string>
